## 🎯 Purpose

This HTML page was deployed in a **safe and authorized lab environment** as part of a red team / penetration testing simulation. Its goal was to simulate the visual impact of a ransomware-style message after initial access, in order to:

- Train end users and blue teams to recognize threats
- Demonstrate post-exploitation presence to clients
- Reproduce a real-world scenario with no actual harm

---

## 🧪 Environment

- ✅ Fully controlled and isolated lab
- 🔐 No real encryption or data access
- 👥 Authorized users and systems only
- 📚 Educational/awareness objectives only

## 📄 Legal & Ethical Notice

> This project is for **educational and demonstrative purposes** only.  
> It must **never** be used on real environments without **explicit legal authorization**.
